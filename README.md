# Assignment: Recipe Manager Application

## Objective:
Develop a Python program that allows users to manage their cooking recipes. The application should enable users to add new recipes, view all recipes, search for recipes by ingredient or name, and categorize recipes.

The purpose is to encourage you to think about how data can be organized, manipulated, and retrieved in a way that is useful and user-friendly.

## Requirements:
1. **Recipe Entry:**
   - Each recipe should be represented as a dictionary containing details such as name, list of ingredients, category (e.g., Dessert, Main Course, Appetizer), and cooking instructions.
   - Users can add new recipes through the console, specifying all necessary details (Provided).

2. **Viewing Recipes:**
   - Implement a feature to display a list of all recipes, including their names, categories, ingredients and cooking instructions.

3. **Searching:**
   - Allow users to search for recipes by name or ingredient. The search should be flexible, returning results that contain the search term within the recipe name or ingredient list.

4. **Categorization:**
   - Users should be able to view recipes by category. Implement a feature to filter recipes based on their assigned category.

5. **Data Persistence (Optional Advanced Feature):**
   - Implement a way to save and load the recipe data using a CSV file. This will allow the recipe collection to persist between program executions.
